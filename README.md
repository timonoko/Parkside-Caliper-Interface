This is the same as https://github.com/Matthias-Wandel/caliper-interface

But Lidl Parkside Caliper has 3V battery and thus the signal level is 2V, so
level adjustement not needed.

Protocol is little different, bits are grouped in fives, with longer pause betweeen. 

You can connect ESP8266 directly, you dont need even battery, because 3V available in caliper.
